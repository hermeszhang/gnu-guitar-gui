 * Revision 1.2  2006/07/26 23:09:09  alankila
 * - DirectSound may be buggy; MMSystem at least worked in mingw build.
 * - remove some sound-specific special cases in gui and main code.
 * - create thread in windows driver.
 * - remove all traces of "program states" variable.
 * - remove snd_open mutex: it is now unnecessary. Concurrency is handled
 *   through joining/waiting threads where necessary. (We assume JACK
 *   does its own locking, though.)
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2006/05/29 18:36:54  anarsoul
 * Initial JACK support
